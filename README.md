Debian base image

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

Debian is a complete Free Operating System!

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will give you a base Debian image with some additional tweaks like some bin‚Äôs (curl, tini) which are present by default and it will not cache any packages. It will also execute the script ```/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh``` via [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini).

If used as a base image for your own image simply leave out your own **ENTRYPOINT** to use the default one and provide your own ```/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh```.

# COMPOSE ‚úÇÔ∏è
