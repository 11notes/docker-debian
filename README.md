Debian base image

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

Debian is a complete Free Operating System!

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will give you a base Debian image with some additional tweaks like some bin‚Äôs (curl, tini) which are present by default and it will not cache any packages. It will also execute the script ```/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh``` via [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini).

If used as a base image for your own image simply leave out your own **ENTRYPOINT** to use the default one and provide your own ```/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh```.

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image is very small

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.
